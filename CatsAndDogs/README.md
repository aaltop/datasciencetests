# Single shot multibox detector implementation

A multi-class object detection network based on the [Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)
by Liu *et al.*, with some inspiration from the [Dive into deep learning book.](https://d2l.ai/).

Required packages can be most easily be installed using [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/),
